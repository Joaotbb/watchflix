# WatchFlix - React & Tailwind

WatchFlix is a project developed as part of the final project for the Flag.pt front-end module. It is a web application built using ReactJS and styled with Tailwind CSS. The purpose of this project is to create a movie and TV show catalog where users can browse and search for their favorite content.

## Development Process

1. Project Setup: Set up the React project structure, including the necessary dependencies and configuration files. Initialize Git for version control.

2. Wireframing: Create wireframes and design mockups to establish the project's visual layout and user interface components.

3. Component Development: Implement individual React components based on the wireframes and design mockups. Ensure proper component hierarchy and reusability.

4. Data Fetching: Integrate with the back-end APIs to fetch movie and TV show data. Implement data fetching mechanisms using Axios and handle API responses.

5. Catalog and Search: Develop the catalog feature, allowing users to browse movies and TV shows by genre, view popular titles, and search for specific content. Implement search functionality with real-time suggestions.

6. Watchlist: Implement the watchlist feature, allowing users to add movies and TV shows to their watchlist.

7. Responsive Design: Make the project responsive by applying CSS

8. SEO: SEO component with title and description using React Helmet.
